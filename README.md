# HackersRank solutions commited by me.
This project contains all my commited HackersRank solutions.
All solutions are implemented in their own files.
Every solution's fully qualified name follows the same pattern that 
reflects the challenge module, submodule, challenge name.

## Solution name pattern
com.oriaxx77.{module}...{submodule}...ChallengeName 

e.g.: The solution for the TwoCharacters challenge (https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/two-characters)

is implemented in the com.oriaxx77.hackersranksolutions.algorithms.strings.TwoCharacters class.

All solutions contain a main method. These are usually read from the console.

## Open issues
- Refactor them according to clean coding.
- Write unit tests based on the HackersRank sample input/output
- Write the JavaDoc
